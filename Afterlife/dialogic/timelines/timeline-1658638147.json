Purgatory, the astral plane, the other side, the beyond.\nThe biggest misconception is that you don't even need to die to end up here. \nYour soul just needs to separate from your body somehow and get caught up by the energies that run this place.\n Psychedelic drugs could do it, astral projection, blunt force trauma, you name it."
